# Preliminaries

If you have yet to install VISION, we recommend installing the package from Github to install this package. Full source code can be found at the VISION Github repository, available [here](http://www.github.com/YosefLab/VISION).

```r
require(devtools)
install_github("YosefLab/VISION")
```

Once VISION and R are installed, you may load in VISION using `library(VISION)`.

# Using VISION

Running an analysis with vision consists of three steps:

1. Creating the VISION object
2. Running the `analyze` function
3. Browsing results

## Creating the VISION object

Creating the VISION object requires a gene expression matrix and *either* a list of Gene Signatures or a data.frame of meta-data.

In this example - both are provided.

```{r, collapse=F, message=T, eval=F}
# Load VISION
library(VISION)

# Read in expression counts (Genes X Cells)
counts <- read.table("data/expression_counts.txt.gz",
                     header = TRUE,
                     sep = '\t',
                     row.names = 1)

# Scale counts within a sample
n.umi <- colSums(counts)

scaled_counts <- t(t(counts) / n.umi) * median(n.umi)

# Read in meta data (Cells x Vars)
meta = read.table("data/glio_meta.txt.gz", sep='\t', header=T, row.names=1)

vis <- Vision(scaled_counts,
              signatures = c("data/h.all.v5.2.symbols.gmt"),
              meta = meta)
```

**Expression Data**

The provided expression data should be scaled and normalized.  The example above shows just a simple UMI-scaling, but it is recommended to apply more advanced normalization procedures such as batch correction or removal of technical confounders.

The expression data should not be log-transformed prior to loading into VISION.

**Signatures**

Signatures can be provided as a list of paths to signature files (\*.gmt) or Signature objects.

See [the signature vignette](Signatures.html) for more information on finding or creating gene Signatures.

**Meta Data**

An R data.frame with cell-level meta-data.  This could be confounding variables (e.g. percentage of mitochondrial RNA, number of genes detected) or experimental covariates (e.g. genotype, donor, batch).

This input is optional if Signatures are provided.

**Other Options**

Other options and inputs can be provided to customize how VISION runs.  For information on this, see the "Customizing VISION Analysis" section below.

## Running an Analysis

To run an analysis, simply call the analyze function:

```{r, collapse=T, message=F, eval=F}
# Set the number of threads when running parallel computations
# On Windows, this must either be omitted or set to 1
options(mc.cores = 2)

vis <- analyze(vis)
```

## Viewing Results

With the processed Vision object, a dynamic web report can be generated with the `viewResults()` function.

```{r, collapse=T, message=F, results=F, eval=F}
viewResults(vis)
```

This will launch a browser running the interactive report.

Other options (port, host, browser) can be provided to control how this occurs.  For example, if you are launching a report on a remote server (such as an AWS instance) and want to make it accessible to others, run this with `host="0.0.0.0"`, some selected port number (e.g. `port=8888`), and `browser=FALSE` (so a browser isn't auto-opened).  Then the report should be available at "\<your instance IP address\>:8888".  (Note:  You will also likely need to enable inbound traffic on your selected port for this to work correctly).

Alternately, you can work with the VISION object directly in R. For example:

```{r, collapse=T, message=F, results=F, eval=F}
# Display autocorrelation coefficients, p-values for signatures
head(getSignatureAutocorrelation(vis))


# Plot signature scores for a signature of interest
tsne <- getProjections(vis)[["tSNE30"]]
sigScores <- getSignatureScores(vis)[, "HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE"]

library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + aes(x=tsne[, 1], y=tsne[, 2], color=sigScores) + geom_point()
```

For more details on accessing computed data within the VISION object, see the [References](https://yoseflab.github.io/VISION/reference/index.html) page.

## Customizing the Latent Space

VISION requires a latent space to model the similarity between cells (used to determine a cell's local neighborhood).

By default, this is calculated via PCA on a subset of the genes.  A few arguments control this process:

- `projection_genes` - controls how genes are selected for PCA.  Options are:
    - `"threshold"` - use a threshold to select genes.  The `threshold` argument specifies either the number or proportion of genes in which a cell must be expressed to be included.
    - `"fano"` - first the "threshold" filter is applied.  Then genes are ordered by mean expression into 30 bins and within each bin, genes with a high Fano factor (2 MAD above the median) are retained
    - character vector of gene names - specify the genes to use directly

### Specifying a Custom Latent Space

Alternately, if a latent space has been computed elsewhere (either via PCA, or other factor analysis methods such as [ZIFA](https://github.com/epierson9/ZIFA), [ZINB-WaVE](https://github.com/drisso/zinbwave) or [scVI](https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI)) it can be provided via the `latentSpace` argument as a data frame.

## Micropooling

scRNA-seq experiments have grown in size over the past couple of years, and as such we have provided an algorithm for pooling together similar cells and continuing with analysis, thus reducing the cell-wise time complexity of the VISION pipeline. For more information, please see our micropooling vignette.

You can control the parameters of the micropooling algorithm using two arguments:

- `pool` - boolean specifying whether or not to apply micropooling.  By default this is set to 'auto' and micropooling is run when the number of cells exceeds 15,000.
- `cellsPerPartition` - integer specifying the target number of cells per micropool.


## Adding 2d Projections

Two-dimensional projections are used to visualize the data in the output report.

By default, VISION computes tSNE on the latent space for visualization.  However, other options are availabled via the `projection_methods` argument.

Often times, users will have pre-computed projections that they would like to use for visualizing their data (e.g. a pre-computed tSNE, or UMAP projection). In this case, the `addProjection()` method can be used to add this view of the data to the output report.

```{r, collapse=T, message=F, results=F, eval=F}
projection <- read.csv("umap_results.csv")

# projection is a matirx or data.frame of dimension (Cells x 2)

vis <- addProjection(vis, "UMAP", projection)
```
