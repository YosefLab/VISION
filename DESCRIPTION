Description: VISION provides functional interpretation of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) latent manifolds through the use of biological signatures (which can be downloaded from online) and precomputed metadata such as clustering assignments, disease status of a cell, or the number of UMIs observed in a cell. VISION can operate downstream of other common analyses such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, or trajectory analysis of scRNA-seq data. VISION produces an interactive web-based output report that can be easily shared with other collaborators or the greater scientific community with ease.
